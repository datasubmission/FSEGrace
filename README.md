## Grace: Graph-based representation learning  for coverage-based fault localization

Grace is a coverage-based fault localization approach with graph-based representation. This repository includes data and code about the technique.

###  Code
This directory presents main implementation of Grace, including the default version, and four variant versions.

* *Default*  presents the implementation of default Grace, including the code on model and code on input graph construction.

* *Variants*  presents four variants in terms of graph representations and ranking loss.

    * *Loss.* Replace list loss with pair and point loss.
    * *Representation.* Replace fine-grained test and code representations with coarse-grained ones.


###  Data
This directory presents raw results and additional results not put in the paper due to space limits.

* *Raw_results*  presents suspiciousness scores of each program entity generated by Grace.

* *Configure_impact* presents the impact of different configruations on performance of Grace, including epoch, batch size, and learning rate. As shown by the results, Grace performs stably over different configurations.
